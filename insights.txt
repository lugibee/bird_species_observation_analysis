Insights from the EDA Output
The EDA output provides a detailed analysis of the Forest and Grassland datasets across multiple sheets (representing different administrative units). Below are the key insights derived from the output:

1. General Observations
Number of Columns:

Both datasets (Forest and Grassland) have 29 columns.
These columns include location information, observation details, environmental conditions, and species data.
Missing Values:

The Sub_Unit_Code column has a significant number of missing values across all sheets, making it less useful for analysis.
The Sex column has a high percentage of missing values in both datasets, which may limit its use for sex ratio analysis.
The Distance column has a few missing values in most sheets, but the impact is minimal.
The AcceptedTSN column has occasional missing values, but it is not critical for most analyses.
Data Consistency:

The Year column consistently contains the value 2018, indicating that all observations were recorded in the same year.
The Location_Type column is consistent within each dataset (Forest for the Forest dataset and Grassland for the Grassland dataset).
2. Forest Dataset Insights
a. Administrative Units
The Forest dataset contains data from multiple administrative units, such as:
ANTI (Antietam National Battlefield)
CATO (Catoctin Mountain Park)
CHOH (Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park)
GWMP (George Washington Memorial Parkway)
HAFE (Harpers Ferry National Historical Park)
MANA (Manassas National Battlefield Park)
MONO (Monocacy National Battlefield)
NACE (National Capital East Parks)
PRWI (Prince William Forest Park)
ROCR (Rock Creek Park)
WOTR (Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts)
b. Environmental Conditions
Temperature:
The temperature ranges from 15.2°C to 29.6°C across the Forest dataset.
The average temperature is around 22°C, with slight variations between administrative units.
Humidity:
Humidity ranges from 63% to 97.9%, with an average of around 80%.
Higher humidity levels are observed in some units (e.g., CHOH, GWMP).
Sky and Wind:
Common sky conditions include Cloudy/Overcast, Clear or Few Clouds, and Mist/Drizzle.
Wind conditions are generally calm or light breezes.
c. Species Observations
The dataset includes a variety of bird species, identified by their Common_Name and Scientific_Name.
The PIF_Watchlist_Status column indicates that some species are at risk and require conservation focus.
d. Missing Data
The Sex column has a high percentage of missing values (e.g., 1511 missing values in CHOH).
The Distance column has a few missing values (e.g., 30 missing values in CHOH).
e. Observers
Observations were conducted by multiple observers, such as Elizabeth Oswald, Kimberly Serno, and Brian Swimelar.
3. Grassland Dataset Insights
a. Administrative Units
The Grassland dataset also contains data from multiple administrative units, such as:
ANTI (Antietam National Battlefield)
CATO (Catoctin Mountain Park)
CHOH (Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park)
GWMP (George Washington Memorial Parkway)
HAFE (Harpers Ferry National Historical Park)
MANA (Manassas National Battlefield Park)
MONO (Monocacy National Battlefield)
NACE (National Capital East Parks)
PRWI (Prince William Forest Park)
ROCR (Rock Creek Park)
WOTR (Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts)
b. Environmental Conditions
Temperature:
The temperature ranges from 19°C to 37.3°C across the Grassland dataset.
The average temperature is slightly higher than in the Forest dataset.
Humidity:
Humidity ranges from 63% to 98.8%, with an average of around 80%.
Sky and Wind:
Common sky conditions include Cloudy/Overcast, Clear or Few Clouds, and Mist/Drizzle.
Wind conditions are generally calm or light breezes.
c. Species Observations
Similar to the Forest dataset, the Grassland dataset includes a variety of bird species.
The PIF_Watchlist_Status column indicates that some species are at risk and require conservation focus.
d. Missing Data
The Sub_Unit_Code column has a significant number of missing values (e.g., 3588 missing values in ANTI).
The Distance column has a high percentage of missing values in some sheets (e.g., 678 missing values in MONO).
e. Observers
Observations were conducted by multiple observers, such as Elizabeth Oswald, Kimberly Serno, and Brian Swimelar.
