# Bird Species Observation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the distribution and diversity of bird species in two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. The goal is to understand how environmental factors influence bird populations and behavior, providing insights for biodiversity conservation and habitat management.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard for data exploration.
- Insights into species diversity, activity patterns, and environmental correlations.
